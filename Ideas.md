The main questions we want to answer are mostly the ones that Marios has asked us. 

1) How deeply do users actually consume the tour content?

2) Where do users drop off during the tour experience

3) Are users actively listening or passively letting audio play?

4) Do users follow the intended story order or jump around?

5) What does a succesfull tour look like? 

6) Cluster users based on listening behaviour

7) Language translation choice optimization
